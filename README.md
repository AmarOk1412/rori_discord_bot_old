# rori_discord_bot

![](https://travis-ci.org/AmarOk1412/rori_discord_bot.svg?branch=master)

RORI Discord Bot is an entry and an endpoint for _[RORI](https://github.com/AmarOk1412/rori/)_. This application is designed for a bot user on [Discord](http://discordapp.com/) based on this [library](https://github.com/SpaceManiac/discord-rs) to interact with _RORI_.

# Installation

This application requires _Rust_ (please read this [page](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)), _openssl_ and _libsodium_. To build the software, you just have to launch `cargo build` in this repository.

# Configuration

## Create a Discord Bot

Please read this [page](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2) to create a bot on Discord. When you have successfully created a bot on Discord, you can open _config_endpoint.json_ and write:

```json
"botname": "THE NAME OF YOUR BOT",
"channel": "THE CHANNEL ID ON DISCORD",
"token":"THE TOKEN OF YOUR BOT",
```

## Connect to rori_server

Note: you need to configure a `rori_server` first.

### Entry point side

_TODO: I need to remove this file_.<br>
You can configure the connection from _config_server.json_:

```json
{
 "ip":"IP of rori_server",
 "port":"port"
}
```

Moreover, you need to choose a secret (for the authentification) and a name for this entry point and write it in _config_endpoint.json_.

### rori_server side

You need to authorize the entrypoint to communicate with `rori_server`. In _config_server.json_ you need to add:

```json
"authorize": [
  {
    "name":"the name you choose",
    "secret":"sha256 of the secret you choose"
  }
]
```

## Authorize rori_server

You need to authorize `rori_server` to communicate with you. In _config_server.json_ you must add:

```json
"authorize": [
  {
    "name":"the name of the rori_server",
    "secret":"sha256 of the secret of the rori_server"
  }
]
```

## Tls configuration

All connections need to be secured. So you need to generate a private key and a certificate. On linux, you can run this following command: `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem`. It will create a certificate (_cert.pem_) and a private key (_key.pem_). Now, you can add these files to _config_endpoint.json_.

## Final

The final _config_endpoint.json_ should look like this:

```json
{
 "ip":"0.0.0.0",
 "port":"1416",
 "rori_ip":"127.0.0.1",
 "rori_port":"1412",
 "owner":"*",
 "name":"rori_discord_bot",
 "compatible_types":"text",
 "cert":"key/cert.pem",
 "key":"key/key.pem",
 "secret": "secret",
 "botname": "THE NAME OF YOUR BOT",
 "channel": "THE CHANNEL ID ON DISCORD",
 "token":"THE TOKEN OF YOUR BOT",
 "authorize": [
   {
     "name":"rori_server",
     "secret":"2BB80D537B1DA3E38BD30361AA855686BDE0EACD7162FEF6A25FE97BF527A25B"
   }
 ]
}
```

# Execution

A binary is present in the _target/_ directory after a `cargo build` or you can execute `cargo run` in your shell.
